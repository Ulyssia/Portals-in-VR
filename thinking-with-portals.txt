Comments:

This is a creative and challenging project.  The exploration of portals in VR is quite interesting, and the integration with the WIM was particularly novel.  I could tell you put a lot of work into making the portals work, which is commendable.  

I did encounter some bugs in some of the interactions.  In particular, the WIM appears to have colliders attached that causing collision issues, which made locomotion freak out and made me fall into infinity several times.

The graphical implementation of portals in VR is complicated, so I did not deduct any points for the visual texture.
